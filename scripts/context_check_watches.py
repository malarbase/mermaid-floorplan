"""Check if modified files affect any freshness-tracked context files.

Takes one or more file paths (files that were modified) and checks if they
match any watch globs in freshness-tracked context files. Designed to be
fast and silent for git hooks — only prints warnings when matches are found.

Usage:
    python3 context_check_watches.py <file1> [file2] ...

Exit code is always 0 (warnings are informational, never block commits).
Requires: git in PATH.
